# covidoutbreak
Python script to plot covid outbreak by province in a region (Italy)

# datasaource
the script read the most up-to-date total covid19 cases in Italy from the official repository of the "Protezione Civile"

# tools
I have used Colaboratory from google that generates Jupyter compliant notebooks

# purpose
this was to me, during lockdown, a pastime to learn a little bit of python, data analysis and data visualization using publicly available opendata
